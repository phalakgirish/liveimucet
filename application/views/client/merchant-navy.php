				<!-- <strong>What is Merchant Navy?</strong> -->
					<p>Merchant navy is a fleet of civilian ships engaged in transporting goods and sometimes even passengers.You will have to work on-board the merchant ships, sail around the world, visit exotic places and at the same time draw handsome salary.</p>
					<p>Let us start on the journey to understand what precisely the term Merchant Navy stands for? Well, Merchant Navy is a fleet of commercial vessels or civilian ships. Of course, we are not talking here about warships. Rather we are talking about merchant ships engaged in transporting commodities and sometimes even passengers mainly in international waters.  Merchant navy is also sometimes referred as Merchant Marines, particularly in USA.</p>
					<!-- <strong>Indian Merchant Navy</strong> -->
					<p>Now let us familiarise one more related term called Merchant Shipping. Well,  Merchant shipping is a comprehensive  term that is  all inclusive  and  which suggests shipping of goods via sea and other means as well ,  such as via  rail   and road etc. Without Merchant Navy, we can’t imagine a comfortable living because Shipping plays a significant role  worldwide.</p>
					<p>
						According to  Mr Efthymios Mitropoulos ,  a former secretary general of  International Maritime Organization ( IMO) , a body of United Nations to regulate shipping, “ Without shipping  half the world would freeze, and another half would   starve.” Well this is quite essential to understand that oil transported to Europe and other cold regions is used to  keep warm such countries.  Same time there are countries which depend upon food supply from others.<br/>
						Do not confuse Merchant Navy with Naval forces as both are entirely different professions. The Merchant Navy offers transportation of commodities where in the case of Naval forces, you are selected to guard the sovereignty of a country.<br/>
						If you are looking for a challenging career, interested visiting the exotic place and draw handsome salary then there are various options for you in the field of Merchant Navy. The international waters are full of opportunities and adventures, and with proper training, you can rule the ocean in best possible manner. Horizon is the limit if you take up this career.
